\section{Controller Optimization}

Given the physical simulation, we can design controllers to enable the robot to achieve various locomotion tasks in the simulated environment. The three tasks that we use to test our system are rising from a leaning, sitting or kneeling position to an erect stance (Figure \ref{fig:task}). For each task, the joint configuration of the initial pose and the final pose are provided by the user. The goal of controller optimization is to find a sequence of control signals $\bar{q}(t)$ so that the robot can move from the initial to the final pose without losing balance. We purposefully choose to use only feedforward controllers\footnote{There is still an internal feedback loop in the actuators to track the desired joint angle (See Chapter~\ref{sec:motorDynamics}). However, this feedback loop is not fully programmable.} in this work, which means that the control signal $\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t)$ is a only function of time $t$ and does not depend on the states of the robot. With the feedforward control alone, the controller transfer can only succeed if the simulation is close enough to the real-world environment. This will put the simulation calibration subsystem into more thorough tests.

We first formulate a trajectory optimization problem for each task.
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:obj}&\max_{\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t),T} V_{ctrl}(\mathbf{x}(t))\\
\nonumber  \mathrm{subject\;} &\mathrm{to} \\
\label{eqn:dyn1} & \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\dot{x}}) =\tau(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, \bar{\mathbf{q}}) + \mathbf{J}^T\mathbf{f}\\
\label{eqn:boundary1}&\bar{\mathbf{x}}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0\\
\label{eqn:boundary2}&\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t) = \mathbf{q}_T, \text{if } t \geq T
\end{align}

This optimization searches for the duration $T$ of the rising motion and the trajectory of the desired joint configuration $\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t)$ to maximize a task-related fitness function $V_{ctrl}$, and subject to physical constraints (eq.(\ref{eqn:dyn1})) and boundary conditions (eq.(\ref{eqn:boundary1}) and (\ref{eqn:boundary2})). $\mathbf{x}_0$ is the initial condition, and $\mathbf{q}_T$ is the final pose (Figure \ref{fig:task}), both of which are provided by the user. Note that although we can specify the global translation $\mathbf{p}_0$, rotation $\mathbf{r}_0$ and joint angles $\mathbf{q}_0$ in the initial condition, we can only specify the desired joint angles for the final pose because the global translation and rotation are determined by the physical simulation.

We parameterize the desired trajectory $\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t)$ to reduce the dimension of the optimization problem. Although there are many ways that we can parameterize the control space, designing the most effective control parametrization is not the focus of this work. In this work, we choose a simple parametrization: We use a sparse set of keyframes $\bar{\mathbf{q}}_1, \bar{\mathbf{q}}_2, ..., \bar{\mathbf{q}}_n$ to parameterize the trajectory of the desired poses $\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t)$. In between the keyframes, we linearly interpolate the poses from two adjacent keyframes. With this simplification, the \emph{control parameters} that we need to optimize reduce to only a few keyframes and the time interval between adjacent keyframes. 

Assuming no interbody collision happens when the robot executes $\bar{\mathbf{q}}(t)$, in our tasks, the robot can alway reach the final pose $\mathbf{q}_T$ within a small error due to the weight of the bodies that each actuator supports. The criterion of success for all the tasks is whether the robot remains upright at the end of its motion. We use the following fitness function to reward controllers that keep balance throughout the entire motion.

\begin{equation}
  V_{ctrl}(\mathbf{x}(t))=\int_0^{T+1} \frac{1}{\alpha(t)+\epsilon}\mathrm{d}t
  \label{eqn:controllerObj}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(t)$ is the angle between the up direction in the local frame of the robot's torso and the up direction in the global frame $(0,0,1)$. It measures how far the robot is to losing its balance. $\epsilon$ is a small positive number to prevent the denominator from being zero. We choose $\epsilon=0.1$ in all our tasks. Note that the upper limit of the integration is $T+1$. The extra one second is to wait the robot to settle down. We use the time horizon $T+1$ because it is still possible that the robot can fall during the settling down phase and our fitness function will penalize this situation.

During the motion, discrete contact events can happen frequently. They impose additional challenges for the continuous optimization algorithms that rely on gradient information. To overcome this challenge, we choose to use CMA to optimize the control parameters. CMA is a sample-based stochastic optimization algorithm that does not need gradient information and is also robust to local minima. In contrast to many evolutionary algorithms, CMA has a solid theoretical fundation \cite{akimoto:2010,glasmachers:2010}. For the completeness of the paper, we will briefly describe the CMA algorithm in our context. Please refer to the original paper \cite{Hansen:2009} for more details. In our case, a CMA sample is a candidate controller, which is characterized by a set of key poses and the time intervals between them. At each iteration, a population of CMA samples are drawn from an underlying Gaussian distribution. Each CMA sample is then simulated and evaluated using eq.(\ref{eqn:controllerObj}). A portion of the samples with lower fitness values are discarded. The underlying Gaussian distribution is updated according to the remaining good samples. With more iterations, the distribution gradually converges to a better region of the control space. After a maximum number of iterations, we choose the best CMA sample that we have ever evaluated as the output of the controller optimization subsystem.
